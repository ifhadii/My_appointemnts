🗓️ My Appointment Manager

My Appointments is a simple and interactive web app that helps users organize and track their upcoming meetings or personal appointments in one place.

The app allows users to easily add new appointments, edit or delete existing ones, and automatically displays how much time is left until each event starts. It also includes a built-in calendar view that visually highlights days with scheduled appointments.

All data is stored locally in the browser, so users can return anytime without losing their appointments. In addition, users can export their appointments as a backup file or import them later to restore their schedule.

This project focuses on providing an intuitive and fast appointment management experience — all running completely offline inside the browser.
